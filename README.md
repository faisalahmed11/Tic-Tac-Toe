### my-process
With Frontend learnings it became possible to complete this project, using HTML , Sass and JS, starting with layout of the app, then with HTML and JS I covered the rest of the project.

This challenge was more challenging then the rest of others I have done. I had to manage routing and state management, 

### what-i-learned

As you know, practice is the only way of getting hands on best practices, therefore as I practice, I learn how to practice more. How to write more clean and optimized code.

### Built with
